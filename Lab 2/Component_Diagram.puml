FSM --> APIGW : Captures fingerprint data
APIGW --> BPM : Forwards data for processing
BPM --> MLModel : Generates fingerprint template
MLModel --> AS : Performs ML inference\n(validates fingerprint)
AS --> UMM : Manages user information
AS --> LS : Logs authentication events
UMM --> UDB : Reads/Writes user profiles
LS --> LDB : Stores log events
