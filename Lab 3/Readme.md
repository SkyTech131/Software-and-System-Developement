# Fingerprint Biometric Authentication System - Use Case Diagram

This document provides an overview of the functional requirements for the Fingerprint Biometric Authentication System, as depicted in the UML Use Case Diagram. The diagram captures the interactions between system actors and the key functionalities available within the system, including user authentication, enrollment, profile management, and system maintenance.

## Overview

The Use Case Diagram outlines the primary interactions and use cases of the system:

- **User:** Initiates fingerprint capture and authentication.
- **System Administrator:** Manages user profiles, including enrollment, update, and deletion of user data.
- **Security Officer:** Monitors system security alerts and oversees system maintenance.

The key functional flows include:

- **Authentication Flow:** The process where a user captures their fingerprint, which is then preprocessed, features are extracted, and the fingerprint is matched against stored templates to authenticate their identity.
- **Enrollment Flow:** Managed by a system administrator to enroll new users by capturing, processing, and generating a fingerprint template for storage.
- **User Profile Management:** Encompasses enrolling a user, updating user information, and deleting user profiles.
- **Audit and Maintenance:** Enables system administrators and security officers to review audit logs, monitor security alerts, and generate security reports to ensure system integrity.

## Detailed Use Cases

### Authentication Use Cases
- **Capture Fingerprint:** The user initiates the fingerprint scanning process.
- **Preprocess Fingerprint:** The captured fingerprint image is enhanced to reduce noise.
- **Extract Features:** Distinct features from the fingerprint are extracted.
- **Fingerprint Matching:** The system compares the extracted features against stored fingerprint templates to validate the user’s identity.
- **Reattempt Authentication:** If no match is found, the system prompts the user to re-capture their fingerprint and try again.

### Enrollment Use Cases
- **Enroll User:** The system administrator enrolls a new user by capturing their fingerprint.
- **Generate Fingerprint Template:** Following processing, a new fingerprint template is created and stored for future authentication.

### User Profile Management
- **Manage User Profiles:** The system administrator can manage user profiles, which includes enrolling new users, updating existing user data, and deleting users when necessary.

### Audit and Maintenance Use Cases
- **Review Audit Logs:** The system administrator reviews authentication events and system logs to ensure proper system operation.
- **Monitor Security Alerts:** The security officer monitors alerts for any potential security issues.
- **Generate Security Reports:** The system can generate periodic security and performance reports for audit and compliance purposes.

## Conclusion

This Use Case Diagram provides a comprehensive overview of the functional interactions within the Fingerprint Biometric Authentication System. By clearly delineating the roles of users, administrators, and security officers, the diagram ensures that all key processes—including authentication, enrollment, and system maintenance—are addressed. This documentation serves as a blueprint for both system development and subsequent testing and validation efforts.
