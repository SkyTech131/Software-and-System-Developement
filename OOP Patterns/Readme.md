# üß† Object-Oriented Design Patterns in Python

This project demonstrates five commonly used **object-oriented design patterns** implemented in Python:

- **State Pattern (–ü–∞—Ç—Ç–µ—Ä–Ω –°–æ—Å—Ç–æ—è–Ω–∏–µ)**
- **Composite Pattern (–ü–∞—Ç—Ç–µ—Ä–Ω –ö–æ–º–ø–æ–Ω–æ–≤—â–∏–∫)**
- **Iterator Pattern (–ü–∞—Ç—Ç–µ—Ä–Ω –ò—Ç–µ—Ä–∞—Ç–æ—Ä)**
- **Facade Pattern (–ü–∞—Ç—Ç–µ—Ä–Ω –§–∞—Å–∞–¥)**
- **Strategy Pattern (–ü–∞—Ç—Ç–µ—Ä–Ω –°—Ç—Ä–∞—Ç–µ–≥–∏—è)**

Each pattern is implemented as a standalone, easy-to-read example that highlights the **core behavior and usage**.

## üß© 1. State Pattern

**Purpose**: Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.  
**Example Use Case**: A context object switching between modes or phases.

**How it works**:  
- `Context` holds a reference to a `State`.
- Calling `request()` transitions the state and delegates behavior.

## üåø 2. Composite Pattern

**Purpose**: Treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.  
**Example Use Case**: Representing hierarchical tree structures like GUI components or filesystems.

**How it works**:  
- `Leaf` represents a basic object.
- `Composite` can contain `Leaf` and other `Composite` objects.
- Both implement a shared interface.

## üîÅ 3. Iterator Pattern

**Purpose**: Provide a way to access the elements of a collection sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.  
**Example Use Case**: Custom iterable containers.

**How it works**:  
- A custom `Iterator` class implements `__iter__()` and `__next__()`.
- A `Collection` class creates and returns its iterator.

## üéõ 4. Facade Pattern

**Purpose**: Provide a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.  
**Example Use Case**: Simplifying interaction with multiple APIs or services.

**How it works**:  
- Subsystems are encapsulated behind a unified `Facade` interface.
- Client interacts only with the facade.

## ‚öôÔ∏è 5. Strategy Pattern

**Purpose**: Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable.  
**Example Use Case**: Choosing between different behaviors dynamically at runtime (e.g. sorting, data transformation).

**How it works**:  
- The `Context` is configured with a `Strategy` object.
- Strategies are swappable at runtime to change behavior.
